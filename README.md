# Portfolio-challenge

This is an about me page for Aminah Cherry with a portfolio showing bio, photo, and skills ( webapps)

## Description

This page includes a short biography of Dr. Aminah Cherry and aims to highlight her skills as a full stack developer using CSS, HTML, Javascript including ES6, web and third party APIs, node.js, and mySQL among others.

The portfolio will continue to build as the webapps are refined and as Dr. Cherry's language skills continue to broaden. 

While her interests lie primarily in potential for data, AI, games, and webapplications to improve human health and the health of care providers, Creating a broader set of applications help to stretch her knowledge and expose knowledge gaps. 

The creation of this portfolio aids in stretching that knowledge further.
